	<b><u>Matt Kowalski:</u></b> <i>"Listen, do you wanna go back, or do<br /> you wanna stay here? I get it. It's nice up here. You <br />can just shut down all the systems, turn out all the<br /> lights, and just close your eyes and tune out <br />everyone. There's nobody up here that can hurt you.<br /> It's safe. I mean, what's the point of going on?<br /> What's the point of living? Your kid died. Doesn't get any <br />rougher than that. But still, it's a matter of what<br /> you do now. If you decide to go, then you gotta just<br /> get on with it. Sit back, enjoy the ride. You gotta <br />plant both your feet on the ground and start livin'<br /> life. Hey, Ryan? It's time to go home."</i>

	<b><u>Ryan Stone:</u></b> <i>"Hey, Matt? Since I had to listen to <br />endless hours of your storytelling this week, I need<br /> you to do me a favor. You're gonna see a little girl <br />with brown hair. Very messy, lots of knots. She <br />doesn't like to brush it. But that's okay. Her name<br /> is Sarah. Can you please tell her that mama found her<br /> red shoe? She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.<br /> But it was just right under the bed. Give her a big <br />hug and a big kiss from me and tell her that mama <br />misses her. Tell her that she is my angel. And she <br />makes me so proud. So, so proud. And you tell her <br />that I'm not quitting. You tell her that I love her,<br /> Matt. You tell her that I love her so much. Can you<br /> do that for me? Roger that."</i> <br />
